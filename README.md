<h1>Requirement Analysis in Software Development</h1>
The purpose of this repository is to write about requirement analysis in software development.

<h2>What is Requirement Analysis?</h2>
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.

<h2>Why is Requirement Analysis Important?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.</li>
  <li>Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.</li>
  <li>Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.</li>
  <li>Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.</li>
  <li>Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Key Activities in Requirement Analysis</h2>
<ol>
  
  <li>Requirement Gathering
    <ul>
      <li>Engage with stakeholders to collect initial requirements.</li>
      <li>Use various techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Requirement Elicitation
    <ul>
      <li>Refine and elaborate on the gathered requirements.</li>
      <li>Use techniques like brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Requirement Documentation
    <ul>
      <li>Document the requirements in a detailed and structured format.</li>
      <li>Use requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Requirement Analysis and Modeling
    <ul>
      <li>Analyze and prioritize the requirements.</li>
      <li>Create models to visualize and understand the requirements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>Requirement Validation
    <ul>
      <li>Review and validate the requirements with stakeholders.</li>
      <li>Define acceptance criteria and ensure traceability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>Types of Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Functional Requirements
Definition: Describe what the system should do.
Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.</li>
  <li>Non-functional Requirements
Definition: Describe how the system should perform.
Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.</li>
</ul>
