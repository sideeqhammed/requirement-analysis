<h1>Requirement Analysis in Software Development</h1>
The purpose of this repository is to write about requirement analysis in software development.

<h2>What is Requirement Analysis?</h2>
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.

<h2>Why is Requirement Analysis Important?</h2>
- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

<h2>Key Activities in Requirement Analysis</h2>
1. Requirement Gathering
- Engage with stakeholders to collect initial requirements.
- Use various techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops.
2. Requirement Elicitation
- Refine and elaborate on the gathered requirements.
- Use techniques like brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.
3. Requirement Documentation
- Document the requirements in a detailed and structured format.
- Use requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases.
4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- Analyze and prioritize the requirements.
- Create models to visualize and understand the requirements.
5. Requirement Validation
- Review and validate the requirements with stakeholders.
- Define acceptance criteria and ensure traceability.

<h2>Types of Requirements</h2>
- Functional Requirements
Definition: Describe what the system should do.
Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.
- Non-functional Requirements
Definition: Describe how the system should perform.
Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.
